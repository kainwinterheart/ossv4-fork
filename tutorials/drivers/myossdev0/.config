# The .config file is optional. All drivers will inherit the config
# settings of the parent environment. The default device driver settings are
# suitable for PCI devices that work under any operating system and any
# processor architecture.
#
# Let's assume this sample driver is for a sound chip that is only used
# on PC motherboards. Since it's known that it will not be present in
# machines having Sparc or PPC processor it doesn't make any sense to
# ship the driver in OSS packages for other processor architectures.
# The platform=i86pc does the trick. i86pc means systems based on the
# IA32 (AKA x86, i386..i686) architecture and it's 64 bit variants such as 
#x86_64 (AMD64, EMT64).

platform=i86pc
#
#
# It is also possible to make the driver available only for a given operating
# system for example if it depends on some kernel services not available
# anywhere else. This can be done using the targetos keyword. For example
# targetos=Linux and/or targetos=Solaris.
#
# If the driver is known to be incompatible with certain operating system
# it's possible to exclude it using the forfetos keyword. For example
# forgetos=Linux.
