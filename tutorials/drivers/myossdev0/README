This is the step 0 of the sample OSS driver project. This driver
has support for loading/unloading (attach/detach) and nothing else.
More features will be added in the subsequent steps.

To compile this driver it must be copied to a directory with
proper name. So you need to create kernel/drv/myossdev (inside the OSS
source tree) and copy contents of this directory to it. Then follow the
instructions for compiling and installing OSS.
