# PCI subdevice IDs can be used to identify specific models of given device.
# In most cases this is unnecessary but it makes it possible to show more
# meaningful device names in possible configuration utilities. For example
# pcs666,111 means PCI device with subvendor ID of 0x666 and subdevice ID
# of 111.
