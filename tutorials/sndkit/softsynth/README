What is this?
=============

This directory contains a very simple software MIDI organ which is
based on playback of sine waves at various frequencies and amplitudes. Please
see the softsynth.c file for better explanation. This is probably the simpliest
software synthesizer application one can write.

The softsynth.c file contains the original version of this program
(no GUI). It's compatible also with any of the earlier OSS versions if you
use an OSSlib version that contains the MIDI parser library (shipped with
OSS 3.99.1j and later).

The softsynth_gtk.c contains another version of the original program. It
has GTK+ GUI. In addition it uses several services that are only
available in OSS 4.0 and later.
