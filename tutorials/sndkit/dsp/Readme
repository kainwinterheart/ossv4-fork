srec and splay utilities (recplay.c)
====================================

Run "make install" to install "splay" and "srec" into /usr/local/bin.

These programs support recording and playback of digitized
voice. There is several possible parameters to these programs. 
Try "srec -h" and "splay -h" for further information.

The vplay -program in the vplay directory is a improved version of
the recplay.c.
