This directory contains undocumented and unsupported utilities to compile
DSP code for SB Live! and Audigy/2/4. The sblive driver has used precompiled
embedded versions of this code (emu10k1_dsp.h and emu10k2_dsp.h) so these tools
have not been tested for years. However it should still be possible to modify, 
compile and load the code to the card.

Undocumented and unsupported really means that. If you want to use these tools
then you have to obtain the knowledge about the Live!/audigy DSP architecture
yourself. Also you need to figure out how these tools work.

Note! The Makefile required to compile this stuff is included in the "source"
directory of OSS. However this file may not appear in the "build" tree.
