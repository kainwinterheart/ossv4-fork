Release notes for the sndkit collection
=======================================

This directory contains the sources for a set of utilities
included in the OSS package. In addition there is an unsorted collection
of many kind of programming experiments. Some of them don't even work.

We have released these sources just because there is no reason to not to
release them. We hope that somebody finds them interesting.

There is no documentation available for these sources at this moment. They
will be officially released at the some time with OSS 4.0. Most of the files
are created to test recent OSS versions os they will not work with older
implementations such as the kernel freeware OSS drivers (OSS/Free) or
ALSA.

Some of these programs do things that are not necessary in majority of
OSS applications. Please refers to the OSS Programmer's Guide for
proper usage of the API (http://www.opensound.com/pguide).

Most programs have been written by 4Front Technologies but some of the
oldest ones have different origins.

Please contact hannu@opensound.com if you have any questions.

All these programs are released under GNU Public License (GPL) version
2.0 or CDDL (if you prefer it). However there are few files that have
a different license. In that case the copying conditions will be
mentioned in the beginning of the files.

Brief description of the directories
------------------------------------

To compile most of the programs just go to the directory ane execute "make"
or "make install". Some of the programs need to be compiled by hand. Use
"make install" in the main directory to compile and install all of them.

dsp	Very very old utilities. Many of them are still functional.

ossmixer.c	The "reference implementation" of an OSS mixer program. This
program uses the traditional OSS mixer API which is very limited.
Superseded by the ossmix/ and ossxmix/ programs.

ossmplay	A MIDI player that uses the /dev/music API.

The ossmix and ossxmix programs use the OSS mixer extension API that is to
be officially released in OSS 4.0. Some minor changes are still planned to
this API so please keep this in mind if using these sources.

ossmix		A command line OSS mixer.
ossxmix		A GTK+ based mixer/control panel program.
ossrec		A simple command line .wav file recording applet.
ossplay		A command line audio file player (for most file formats)
samples		Few OSS programming sample programs.
awesfx		SB AWE SoundFont Loader for EMU8000 synth.
sblive		DSP compiler/loader and .DSP file sources for the SB Live/Audigy
		driver of OSS. May be very impossible to understand without
		documentation. Sorry for the time being.
tests		Various test programs used to test this and that during
		development of OSS. Can be used as programming examples.
