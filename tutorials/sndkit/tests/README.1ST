Important warning
=================

Many prongrams in this directory are in no way sample programs. Most of them
intentionally misuse the OSS API to force the drivers to fail if there are
any bugs in them. Using this kind of stupid methods in ordinary applications
is asking for troubles.

However some of the programs demonstrate how to use certain new features 
of OSS. In such cases the program name is mentioned somewhere else in the
OSS documentation.
