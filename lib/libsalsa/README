SALSA - Simple ALSA emulation library for OSS
=============================================

The sole purpose of this library is to make certain key ALSA applications
to work with OSS. This is necessary just because some Linux distributions
don't ship utilities like esd or xmss with OSS support compiled in.

This library has been programmed using brute force methods and it's
not designed to be any programming example. We didn't make any attempt to get
all ALSA applications to work with it. Most applications support the OSS
API directly so there is no need for doing this.

We do not have any specific plans to develop this library any further. However
some changes will be made occasionally.

Copying
-------

The seqmid.c, alsakernel.h, alsa-symbols.h and output.c files have been
copied more or less from stock alsa-lib and they have been copyrighted by the
ALSA team members. All parts of this package are distributed under GNU GPL
version 2.1.

Installing and compiling the library
------------------------------------

The precompiled library is already shipped as a part of the OSS package
for Linux 2.6.x and later kernels so there should be no reason to recompile 
it. This library is not applicable under any other operating systems or Linux
versions.

To compile the library you can execute "make". "make install" will install
the library (libsalsa.so.2.0.0) to /usr/lib and then change the required
libasound.so.* symbolic links to point to it.
